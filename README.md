A Digital Twin (DT) is the virtual replica of an actual Cyber-Physical System (CPS). DTs accurately replicate relevant behavioral aspects of a CPS. The purpose of a DT is to perform computations meant to improve the performance of the real CPS that would be resource-intensive if performed on the real system. Examples include the real-time synthesis of adaptation policies under uncertainty or scalability studies.

DTs are increasingly attracting attention within the manufacturing field. Production plants are, indeed, growingly complex due to the high demand for flexible and robust solutions. Furthermore, complex manufacturing systems are highly real-time critical since deadlocks, bottlenecks, and failures can incur efficiency and economic losses.

As engineers, you are in charge of developing the formal DT of a LEGO® MINDSTROMS™ production plant. The work has two main outputs: an Automata-based model of the plant and a formal verification experimental campaign highlighting relevant features of the system.
